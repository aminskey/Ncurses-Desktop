# Ncurses Desktop
Welcome to The Ncurses Desktop Project, also known as AcornDOS.    
To run this desktop you'll need to have the following packages:    

1. build-essentials
2. gcc
3. libncurses-dev
4. libcurl-nss-dev

The Makefile for this desktop project is in the CWorkspace repo.   
Initially this project was made in the CWorskpace repo, but then I moved it in it's own.    
Some programs in the CWorkspace repo rely on the libraries in this repo.    

### Well Enough of that
There is a program in the CWorkspace, that has a very nice GUI for installing this desktop.    
But first we have to build it, and the rest of the cworkspace.
