# Acorn Desk (formerly known as MzDesk)
## The Story
#### Initially was made for AcornDOS(Was known as BOXEmu back then). I wanted to configure the drives for my older desktop "WinSh"
#### So I Had 2 Options
#### 1
##### Edit the program
#### 2
##### Create a whole new and better desktop
#### So I chose number 2 and that lead me to this!!
# The Ncurses Desktop
